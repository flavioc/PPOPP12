  abstract = {We address how to write programs for distributed
     computing systems in which the network topology can change
     dynamically. Examples of such systems, which we call {\em
     ensembles}, include programmable sensor networks (where the
     network topology can change due to failures in the nodes or
     links) and modular robotics systems (whose physical configuration
     can be rearranged under program control). We extend Meld, a logic
     programming language that allows an ensemble to be viewed as a
     single computing system. In addition to proving some key
     properties of the language, we have also implemented a complete
     compiler for Meld. It generates code for TinyOS and for a
     Claytronics simulator. We have successfully written correct,
     efficient, and complex programs for ensembles containing over one
     million nodes.},

     metamodule-based shape planning algorithm and comment on the

     traditional imperative approaches, and that the differences
     between declarative programming styles can themselves contribute
     leverage to different parts of the problem domain.},

    Abstract = {A vast body of theoretical research has focused either on overly simplistic models of parallel computation, notably the PRAM, or overly specific models that have few representatives in the real world. Both kinds of models encourage exploitation of formal loopholes, rather than rewarding development of techniques that yield performance across a range of current and future parallel machines. This paper offers a new parallel machine model, called LogP, that reflects the critical technology trends underlying parallel computers. It is intended to serve as a basis for developing fast, portable parallel algorithms and to offer guidelines to machine designers. Such a model must strike a balance between detail and simplicity in order to reveal important bottlenecks without making analysis of interesting problems intractable. The model is based on four parameters that specify abstractly the computing bandwidth, the communication bandwidth, the communication delay, and the efficiency of coupling communication and computation. Portable parallel algorithms typically adapt to the machine configuration, in terms of these parameters. The utility of the model is demonstrated through examples that are implemented on the CM-5.   <p>Keywords: massively parallel processors, parallel models, complexity analysis, parallel algorithms, PRAM}
