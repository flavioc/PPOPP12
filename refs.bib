  abstract = {We address how to write programs for distributed
     computing systems in which the network topology can change
     dynamically. Examples of such systems, which we call {\em
     ensembles}, include programmable sensor networks (where the
     network topology can change due to failures in the nodes or
     links) and modular robotics systems (whose physical configuration
     can be rearranged under program control). We extend Meld, a logic
     programming language that allows an ensemble to be viewed as a
     single computing system. In addition to proving some key
     properties of the language, we have also implemented a complete
     compiler for Meld. It generates code for TinyOS and for a
     Claytronics simulator. We have successfully written correct,
     efficient, and complex programs for ensembles containing over one
     million nodes.},

     challenges common in modular robot software we have recently
     begun to explore new programming models for modular robot
     ensembles. In this paper we apply two of those models to a
     metamodule-based shape planning algorithm and comment on the
     differences between the two approaches. Our results suggest that
     declarative programming can provide several advantages over more
     traditional imperative approaches, and that the differences
     between declarative programming styles can themselves contribute
     leverage to different parts of the problem domain.},
